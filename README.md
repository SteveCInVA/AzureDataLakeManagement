# AzureDataLakeManagement
This project was created to help simplify the process of managing an Azure Datalake specifically around updating existing ACL's to child objects within the lake.

I wanted to make an easier method for managing an Azure DataLake in an organization that used the names of objects rather than the ID's.

Version History:
2023.12.1 - 12/01/2023
Function optimization and improved consistency of help content.

2023.11.2 - 11/13/2023
